### Description:
Welcome to our project repository, where we explore innovative approaches to automate the testing of polymers for odor and intensity, traditionally a costly and time-consuming process involving professional panels. Our project, outlined in the enclosed report, delves into the use of deep learning models to detect whether polymers are odorless and to identify their specific smells.

#### Highlights:
- **Anomaly Detection**: We utilize anomaly detection techniques to predict odorless polymers, showing promising results in identifying absence of smell efficiently.
- **Multi-Label Classification**: Different models are employed to accurately predict the specific smells emitted by polymers.
- **High-Level Data Fusion**: Combining various models, we achieve superior accuracy in smell prediction, demonstrating the effectiveness of data fusion in enhancing model performance.
This work represents our effort as students to contribute to the field of material science, aiming to provide more streamlined, cost-effective solutions for quality control in polymer production. Dive into our report to see the full methodology, experiments, and insights from our study.
